Google Images Gallery
=====================

This little PHP script mimics the layout of the gallery of images you see when
you do a Google Images search.  It resizes images so that rows of images are
equal-width, with every image on a row having the same height.

Usage
-----
Put your images in the `pics/` directory. Visit `gallery.php`.

Dependencies
------------
 * PHP5
 * [PHP GD Library](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php)
 * Apache 2
